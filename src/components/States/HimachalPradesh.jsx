              With spectacular snowy peaks and plunging river valleys, beautiful
              Himachal is Indiaâ€™s outdoor adventure playground. From trekking
              and climbing to rafting, paragliding and skiing, if it can be done
              in the mountains, it can be done here. A convoluted topography of
              interlocking mountain chains also makes Himachal a spectacular
              place simply to explore, by bus, car, motorbike, jeep or foot.
              Every pass crossing into a new valley brings you into a different
              culture, with its own deities and language.
